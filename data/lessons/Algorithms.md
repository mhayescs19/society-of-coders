An operator is a symbol that carries out mathematical computation.


| Arithmetic operator | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | 
| + | Addition | 1 + 2 = 3 |
| - | Subtraction | 5 - 5 = 0 |
| * | Multiplication | 3 * 2 = 6 |
| / | Division | 4 / 2 = 2 |
| % | Modules | 5 MOD 2 = 1 |


Note:
* Modulus is the remainder of a division.
  - Example: 14 MOD 5 = 4 because the remainder is 4.
* The order of operations that should be performed:
  - Parentheses
  - Modules
  - Multiplication & Division
  - Addition & Subtraction
* Examples:
  - 1 + 2 = 3
  - 5 - 5 = 0
  - 3 * 2 = 6
  - 4 / 2 = 2
  - 5 MOD 2 = 1


| Comparison operator | Description | 
| ------------- | ----------- | 
| = | Equal | 1 = 1 |
| != | Not equal | 2 != 1 |
| < | Less than | 3 < 6 |
| > | Greater than | 6 > 3 |

Note:
* Examples:
  - 1 = 1
  - 2 != 1
  - 3 < 6
  - 6 > 3
